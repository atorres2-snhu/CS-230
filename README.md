**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
**
The client was The Gaming Room, a company that wanted to expand their existing game, Draw It or Lose It, to run on multiple platforms . They asked for a software design that could be added easily to different systems.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
**
I clearly defined the system requirements and broke down the functionality into manageable part. I also paid close attention to pick a platform that matched the client’s need for cross-platform support.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
**
Creating the design document helped me organize my thoughts before writing any code. It allowed me to think through the project structure, classes and potential issues early on.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
**
I would spend more time improving the detailed class diagrams. I would add more clear descriptions for each method and variable to make the design easier to follow for developers who didn’t create it.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
**
I focused on scalability, platform compatibility, and simple gameplay to meet the user’s needs. Considering the user’s needs is important because software has to solve their specific problems. Ignoring the user would result in software that doesn’t meet expectations.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
**
I used a modular, object-oriented design approach. In the future, I would continue using strategies like creating use case diagrams early, applying design patterns when needed, and testing major features first to validate work before full development.
